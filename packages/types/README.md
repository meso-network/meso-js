# `@meso-network/types`

This package provides common TypeScript definitions for [`meso-js`](../meso-js/)
and [`post-message-bus`](../post-message-bus/).

**Why?** The nature of the Meso experience requires these types to be shared
by our public libraries as well as internal products (such as the iframe that
hosts the Meso on/off-ramp).
